# LaraApiTest
This is a simple system to demonstrate API authentication and verification when getting data or sending through data, using Laravel 7, Passport, Composer, Laravel Helpers, LAMP, Postman, Visual Studio Code. Using Linux Os.

Laravel Passport - Laravel uses the Passport library to implement a full OAuth2 server we can use for authentication in our API.(OAuth 2.0 provides consented access and restricts actions of what the client app can perform on resources on behalf of the user, without ever sharing the user's credentials.)

Installation of this project

1.Install Lamp on your pc. 
2.Composer
3.Laravel 7(Create your project at this step with laravel 7)
4.Laravel Passport(Add this to your project)
5.Laravel Helpers after (after step 3 and 4)
6.Copy project contents to your files

Edit your env file details , with details that correspond with your mysql database.
You may need to create a database called Carts_db before you do this and before migration.

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=Carts_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=' '

Open the application in visual studio code, if you navigate to database then click  migrations, you will see all the tables that you need to help run the test, but before that you need to migrate these tables so that, they are created in the database.
